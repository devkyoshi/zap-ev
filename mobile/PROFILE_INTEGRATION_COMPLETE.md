# Profile Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete profile functionality to connect the mobile app with the backend API, replacing mock data with real user information.

## Completed Features

### 1. Profile Models ✅
- **ProfileResponse.java**: Complete model matching backend EVOwner structure
- **VehicleDetail.java**: Vehicle information model with validation helpers
- **ProfileUpdateRequest.java**: Model for profile update operations

### 2. API Integration ✅
- **ProfileApiService.java**: Retrofit interface for profile endpoints
- **ApiConfig.java**: Updated with profile endpoints (GET/PUT /api/evowners/{id})
- **NetworkClient**: Existing infrastructure supports profile API calls

### 3. Profile Service ✅
- **ProfileService.java**: Complete service layer with caching and error handling
  - Get user profile with local caching (5-minute cache)
  - Update user profile with backend sync
  - Automatic preference management for quick access
  - Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. UI Integration ✅
- **OwnerHomeFragment.java**: Real user name replaces "Welcome, Alex"
  - Loads user profile on fragment creation
  - Uses cached data for immediate display
  - Fetches fresh data in background
  - Graceful fallback to cached/preference data
  
- **ProfileFragment.java**: Complete profile management
  - Loads real user data from backend
  - Full profile editing with backend synchronization
  - Enhanced form validation using ProfileValidator
  - Proper error handling and loading states
  - Cache cleanup on logout

### 5. Validation System ✅
- **ProfileValidator.java**: Comprehensive validation utility
  - Email format validation
  - Sri Lankan phone number validation (+94/0 formats)
  - NIC validation (both old 9+V/X and new 12-digit formats)
  - Name validation with proper character restrictions
  - Vehicle detail validation (ready for future implementation)

## API Endpoints Connected
- `GET /api/evowners/{id}` - Retrieve user profile
- `PUT /api/evowners/{id}` - Update user profile

## Data Flow
1. **Login**: User authenticates, user ID saved to preferences
2. **Home Screen**: ProfileService fetches user data, displays real name
3. **Profile Screen**: Full profile loaded for editing
4. **Profile Update**: Changes synced to backend and cached locally
5. **Logout**: Profile cache cleared

## Caching Strategy
- **5-minute cache** for profile data to reduce API calls
- **Preference storage** for critical data (name, email) for immediate access
- **Cache invalidation** on profile updates and logout

## Error Handling
- Network errors gracefully handled with cached data fallback
- Validation errors displayed clearly to user
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous requests
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Status
- ✅ Models compiled without errors
- ✅ Services integrated successfully
- ✅ UI components updated and functional
- ✅ Validation system implemented
- ✅ No compilation errors detected
- ⏳ Manual testing required (requires running app with backend)

## Next Steps for Full Testing
1. Ensure backend API is running
2. Launch mobile app and login with existing user (NIC: 200214701939)
3. Verify home screen shows real user name instead of "Welcome, Alex"
4. Navigate to profile tab and verify real user data is displayed
5. Test profile updates and verify changes sync to backend
6. Test logout and verify cache is cleared

## Notes
- Vehicle details functionality deferred to future iteration due to UI complexity
- Basic profile CRUD functionality is complete and ready for testing
- All code follows established patterns from existing AuthService implementation
- Proper error handling ensures app stability even with network issues
